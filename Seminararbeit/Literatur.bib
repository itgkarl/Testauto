	abstract = {Based on the needs of the educational community, and the software professional, this book takes a unique approach to teaching software testing. It introduces testing concepts that are managerial, technical, and process oriented, using the Testing Maturity Model ({TMM}) as a guiding framework. The {TMM} levels and goals support a structured presentation of fundamental and advanced test-related concepts to the reader. In this context, the interrelationships between theoretical, technical, and managerial concepts become more apparent. In addition, relationships between the testing process, maturity goals, and such key players as managers, testers and client groups are introduced. Topics and features:- Process/engineering-oriented text- Promotes the growth and value of software testing as a profession- Introduces both technical and managerial aspects of testing in a clear and precise style- Uses the {TMM} framework to introduce testing concepts in a systemmatic, evolutionary way to faciliate understanding- Describes the role of testing tools and measurements, and how to integrate them into the testing process Graduate students and industry professionals will benefit from the book, which is designed for a graduate course in software testing, software quality assurance, or software validation and verification Moreover, the number of universities with graduate courses that cover this material will grow, given the evoluation in software development as an engineering discipline and the creation of degree programs in software engineering.},

	shorttitle = {Taming complexity while gaining efficiency},
	doi = {10.1109/AUTEST.2013.6645055},
	abstract = {The current product development environment for mechatronic systems is characterized by tight budgets, reduced development times and immense complexity across the industries - aerospace, automotive, commercial vehicles, etc. A huge emphasis is being given to increase the efficiency in product testing and to make the process more productive in increasing quality, while being cost effective. Companies are seeking software testing tools that offer a comprehensive solution that helps in achieving this goal. Automated software testing for both hardware and the software components is one of the ways the industries are trying to gain efficiency in testing. Given the fact that current mechatronic systems are quite complex, have large numbers and types of {IO} channels, and are implementing distributed real-time control with multiple communication protocols, a test automation tool that incorporates and tests all of the system functionality is highly desirable. In particular, due to the focus on software quality, as more and more functions are added to the network of Electronic Control Units ({ECU}), a greater emphasis is laid on the requirements for a comprehensive automated testing tool. The efficiency in development and planned increase in reuse of test assets is an important consideration for efficiency gain. Bringing clarity to the test description would improve readability and maintainability of these test assets. This paper shows the lessons learned from a similar evolution in Model-Based Design, moving from handwritten code to model-based graphical executable representation, can be applied to the testing arena to develop better and more efficient tests. To make the testing process efficient, the test tool should be able to not just execute tests, but organize the test results and present them in a manner easily understood by the end user. The user should be easily able to select tests to be executed and visualize execution results of those tests without need of external - ata analysis and reporting tools. A user should also be able to gather data related to test execution for reporting on overall software quality metrics. In the case of real-time embedded systems, the traditional approach for software testing of test execution, data capture, analysis and reporting creates a lot of inefficiency and repeated testing. A new approach to run test evaluation in parallel to test execution, using the so-called real-time testing solution, eliminates these inefficiencies and results in significant gains in testing time and improving utilization of the test infrastructure. Globalized, distributed development environments may lead to organizations adopting a variety of tool chains and test platforms. Therefore, to gain efficiency, it is desired that the test automation solution should offer easy integration with other third-party test platforms and be independent of the hardware to protect the investment in the long run. Basing such integration interface on established standards gives the user freedom to make choices. Some standards, such as {HIL} {API} from {ASAM}, are being proposed for test systems in the automotive industry. The paper reviews applicability and benefits of such standards. Various industry standards, such as automotive functional safety standard {ISO} 26262, {IEC} 61508, {IEC} 62304 and {DO}-178C, have addressed requirements for software testing and test tools. It is therefore critical that the selected test automation tool provide support for the prescribed methods and support the standard compliant development process. Tool qualification is a critical topic addressed by these standards and is discussed in this paper. Further, increasingly important requirements such as integration with the overall software development process, management of tests and test data, test reusability, hardware platform independence, test development and execution efficiency, etc. are discussed.},

	abstract = {Test automation is a widely-used approach to reduce the cost of manual software testing. However, if it is not planned or conducted properly, automated testing would not necessarily be more cost effective than manual testing. Deciding what parts of a given System Under Test ({SUT}) should be tested in an automated fashion and what parts should remain manual is a frequently-asked and challenging question for practitioner testers. In this study, we propose a search-based approach for deciding what parts of a given {SUT} should be tested automatically to gain the highest Return On Investment ({ROI}). This work is the first systematic approach for this problem, and significance of our approach is that it considers automation in the entire testing process (i.e., from test-case design, to test scripting, to test execution, and test-result evaluation). The proposed approach has been applied in an industrial setting in the context of a software product used in the oil and gas industry in Canada. Among the results of the case study is that, when planned and conducted properly using our decision-support approach, test automation provides the highest {ROI}. In this study, we show that if automation decision is taken effectively, test-case design, test execution, and test evaluation can result in about 307\%, 675\%, and 41\% {ROI} in 10 rounds of using automated test suites.},

The {pH} and {PCO}2 of the control perfusate were 7.40 and 39 {mmHg}, respectively. In the rabbit septum a metabolic acidosis ({pH} equals 6.82, {PCO}2 equals 39 {mmHg}) caused a loss of 16\% of control tension in 12 min. Na+ and K+ exchange were unaltered. A comparable respiratory acidosis ({pH} equals 6.81, {PCO}2 equals 159 {mmHg}) caused a 51\% loss of tension in 2 min. Na+ exchange was unaltered but K+ efflux fell from 8.9 +/- 0.6 (mean +/- {SE}) to 4.9 +/- 0.3 mmol/kg dry wt per min (P less than 0.001, n equals 10). A net gain of K+ of 16.9 +/- 1.7 (n equals 14) mmol/kg dry wt occurred and was attributable to a delayed fall in K+ influx relative to efflux over 15 min. The net gain could not be mimicked by epinephrine administration or blocked by propranolol and was absent in the beating rat septum and the quiescent rabbit septum. These results suggest that the net uptake of K+, which appears to be dependent on a period of depolarization, and the changes of contractility are controlled by the H+ ion concentration at a cellular site whose exchange with the extracellular space is characterized by a considerable restriction of diffusion. Changes of contractility are not related to the net uptake of K+.},

	title = {Exploring the use of a test automation framework},
	doi = {10.1109/AERO.2009.4839695},
	abstract = {It is known that software testers, more often than not, lack the time needed to fully test the delivered software product within the time period allotted to them. When problems in the implementation phase of a development project occur, it normally causes the software delivery date to slide. As a result, testers either need to work longer hours, or supplementary resources need to be added to the test team in order to meet aggressive test deadlines. One solution to this problem is to provide testers with a test automation framework to facilitate the development of automated test solutions. The benefits of test automation are most apparent in big software projects. The development of automated test cases requires a lot of effort and time during the first test campaign, but there is a significant amount of time that can be saved with each repetition. Test automation gives a software tester the possibility of achieving unattended testing capability. With end-to-end test automation, a tester can schedule tests to run autonomously. While tests are running, testers can utilize the time saved by performing any requisite manual testing, or developing additional automated test cases to increase test coverage. Automated testing saves time as it provides the capability to perform concurrent/parallel testing. A tester can run multiple tests at the same time, whereas manual tests only allow for sequential test runs. If test automation is employed, testing does not have to end when the workday ends; automated testing can be exercised 24times7. A test automation framework can provide numerous benefits to a software tester. A test automation framework provides the basic set of software tools and services that can aid testers as they develop automated test cases. With a test automation framework, software testers can focus on testing the software product instead of worrying about developing the infrastructure needed to support their test environment. When choosing or developing a tes- t automation framework, it is important to understand all the different components of an organization's software system. A good test automation framework should be general enough to provide functions that help a tester create automated tests for all the different components of the delivered software system. The framework should also be easily extensible so it can evolve as the software system evolves. Whether creating one from scratch or using a commercial product, having a test automation framework available for test teams to use can help streamline the process of developing automated test solutions.},

	abstract = {Many software applications today are written as web-based applications to be run in an Internet browser. Selenium is a set of powerful different software tools working with many browsers, operating systems, programming languages, and testing frameworks each with a different approach to supporting automation test for testing web-based applications. {JMeter} is used to simulate a heavy load on a server, network or object to test its strength or to analyze overall performance under different load types. {JMeter} operates at the protocol-level, on the other hand, Selenium works at the user-level. In this paper, authors have designed an automatic software testing framework for web applications based on the Selenium and {JMeter}. With the use of the software framework, we efficiently improve the extensibility and reusability of automated test. The results show that the new software framework improves software products quality and develop efficiency. This paper also illustrates how to design web-based test automation framework in details.},

	abstract = {Although it is widely believed that software quality will be improved by the use of automated testing, automation is still not well-off in industry today. There are quite a few issues of traditional software test automation mode, for example, high cost, knowledge barriers, and management troubles. In the paper, a test automation solution on {GUI} functional test is proposed. The solution integrates test case generation and selection, test case execution, and test reporting to facilitate testing. It introduces the concept of test driver which is designed to take over the communication between test cases and the execution engine. At last, some enhancements are proposed for future work.},

	abstract = {Anopheles balabacensis balabacensis and Anopheles minimus are the main malaria vectors in Thailand. In a cleared forested foothill area in the central part of the country A. minimus was the most prevalent anopheline species found, only 6 specimens of A. b. balabacensis being collected over a 3-year period. Cattle were scarce in the area, tractors being largely used for working in the fields. This situation contributed to high man-vector contact. A minimus occurred throughout the year, with a major peak of density in the dry cool season and a smaller peak in the wet season. The contact of A. minimus with man was much higher outdoors than indoors, and studies showed the species to be an early biter, especially in the dry season, thus increasing the chance of man-vector contact. {DDT} spraying appeared to reduce considerably the estimated vectorial capacities, however, this effect was not maintained and malaria transmission was not interrupted. Trials with supplementary or alternative attack measures are therefore indicated in this particular ecological situation.},
