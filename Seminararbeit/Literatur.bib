	title = {Exploring the use of a test automation framework},
	doi = {10.1109/AERO.2009.4839695},
	abstract = {It is known that software testers, more often than not, lack the time needed to fully test the delivered software product within the time period allotted to them. When problems in the implementation phase of a development project occur, it normally causes the software delivery date to slide. As a result, testers either need to work longer hours, or supplementary resources need to be added to the test team in order to meet aggressive test deadlines. One solution to this problem is to provide testers with a test automation framework to facilitate the development of automated test solutions. The benefits of test automation are most apparent in big software projects. The development of automated test cases requires a lot of effort and time during the first test campaign, but there is a significant amount of time that can be saved with each repetition. Test automation gives a software tester the possibility of achieving unattended testing capability. With end-to-end test automation, a tester can schedule tests to run autonomously. While tests are running, testers can utilize the time saved by performing any requisite manual testing, or developing additional automated test cases to increase test coverage. Automated testing saves time as it provides the capability to perform concurrent/parallel testing. A tester can run multiple tests at the same time, whereas manual tests only allow for sequential test runs. If test automation is employed, testing does not have to end when the workday ends; automated testing can be exercised 24times7. A test automation framework can provide numerous benefits to a software tester. A test automation framework provides the basic set of software tools and services that can aid testers as they develop automated test cases. With a test automation framework, software testers can focus on testing the software product instead of worrying about developing the infrastructure needed to support their test environment. When choosing or developing a tes- t automation framework, it is important to understand all the different components of an organization's software system. A good test automation framework should be general enough to provide functions that help a tester create automated tests for all the different components of the delivered software system. The framework should also be easily extensible so it can evolve as the software system evolves. Whether creating one from scratch or using a commercial product, having a test automation framework available for test teams to use can help streamline the process of developing automated test solutions.},

	shorttitle = {Taming complexity while gaining efficiency},
	doi = {10.1109/AUTEST.2013.6645055},
	abstract = {The current product development environment for mechatronic systems is characterized by tight budgets, reduced development times and immense complexity across the industries - aerospace, automotive, commercial vehicles, etc. A huge emphasis is being given to increase the efficiency in product testing and to make the process more productive in increasing quality, while being cost effective. Companies are seeking software testing tools that offer a comprehensive solution that helps in achieving this goal. Automated software testing for both hardware and the software components is one of the ways the industries are trying to gain efficiency in testing. Given the fact that current mechatronic systems are quite complex, have large numbers and types of {IO} channels, and are implementing distributed real-time control with multiple communication protocols, a test automation tool that incorporates and tests all of the system functionality is highly desirable. In particular, due to the focus on software quality, as more and more functions are added to the network of Electronic Control Units ({ECU}), a greater emphasis is laid on the requirements for a comprehensive automated testing tool. The efficiency in development and planned increase in reuse of test assets is an important consideration for efficiency gain. Bringing clarity to the test description would improve readability and maintainability of these test assets. This paper shows the lessons learned from a similar evolution in Model-Based Design, moving from handwritten code to model-based graphical executable representation, can be applied to the testing arena to develop better and more efficient tests. To make the testing process efficient, the test tool should be able to not just execute tests, but organize the test results and present them in a manner easily understood by the end user. The user should be easily able to select tests to be executed and visualize execution results of those tests without need of external - ata analysis and reporting tools. A user should also be able to gather data related to test execution for reporting on overall software quality metrics. In the case of real-time embedded systems, the traditional approach for software testing of test execution, data capture, analysis and reporting creates a lot of inefficiency and repeated testing. A new approach to run test evaluation in parallel to test execution, using the so-called real-time testing solution, eliminates these inefficiencies and results in significant gains in testing time and improving utilization of the test infrastructure. Globalized, distributed development environments may lead to organizations adopting a variety of tool chains and test platforms. Therefore, to gain efficiency, it is desired that the test automation solution should offer easy integration with other third-party test platforms and be independent of the hardware to protect the investment in the long run. Basing such integration interface on established standards gives the user freedom to make choices. Some standards, such as {HIL} {API} from {ASAM}, are being proposed for test systems in the automotive industry. The paper reviews applicability and benefits of such standards. Various industry standards, such as automotive functional safety standard {ISO} 26262, {IEC} 61508, {IEC} 62304 and {DO}-178C, have addressed requirements for software testing and test tools. It is therefore critical that the selected test automation tool provide support for the prescribed methods and support the standard compliant development process. Tool qualification is a critical topic addressed by these standards and is discussed in this paper. Further, increasingly important requirements such as integration with the overall software development process, management of tests and test data, test reusability, hardware platform independence, test development and execution efficiency, etc. are discussed.},

	abstract = {Test automation is a widely-used approach to reduce the cost of manual software testing. However, if it is not planned or conducted properly, automated testing would not necessarily be more cost effective than manual testing. Deciding what parts of a given System Under Test ({SUT}) should be tested in an automated fashion and what parts should remain manual is a frequently-asked and challenging question for practitioner testers. In this study, we propose a search-based approach for deciding what parts of a given {SUT} should be tested automatically to gain the highest Return On Investment ({ROI}). This work is the first systematic approach for this problem, and significance of our approach is that it considers automation in the entire testing process (i.e., from test-case design, to test scripting, to test execution, and test-result evaluation). The proposed approach has been applied in an industrial setting in the context of a software product used in the oil and gas industry in Canada. Among the results of the case study is that, when planned and conducted properly using our decision-support approach, test automation provides the highest {ROI}. In this study, we show that if automation decision is taken effectively, test-case design, test execution, and test evaluation can result in about 307\%, 675\%, and 41\% {ROI} in 10 rounds of using automated test suites.},

In a cleared forested foothill area in the central part of the country A. minimus was the most prevalent anopheline species found, only 6 specimens of A. b. balabacensis being collected over a 3-year period. Cattle were scarce in the area, tractors being largely used for working in the fields. This situation contributed to high man-vector contact. A minimus occurred throughout the year, with a major peak of density in the dry cool season and a smaller peak in the wet season. The contact of A. minimus with man was much higher outdoors than indoors, and studies showed the species to be an early biter, especially in the dry season, thus increasing the chance of man-vector contact. {DDT} spraying appeared to reduce considerably the estimated vectorial capacities, however, this effect was not maintained and malaria transmission was not interrupted. Trials with supplementary or alternative attack measures are therefore indicated in this particular ecological situation.},
